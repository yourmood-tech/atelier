  "fond-blanc": "Take THIS EXACT RING from the attached image and place it on a pure white catalog background, in Mood Collection signature catalog pose. Pixel-precise design preservation is the #1 priority.\n\n⛔ THE RING'S DESIGN MUST BE PRESERVED EXACTLY — IDENTICAL, PIXEL-PRECISE.\n- Same EXACT shape and silhouette.\n- Same EXACT colors and materials (steel, titanium, aluminum, gold, etc.).\n- Same EXACT decoration : count and preserve every single decoration element. If the ring has 4 rows of pavé diamonds, output 4 rows. If it has 26 gemstones, output 26 gemstones. If it has engraved mountain peaks with diamonds inside, output mountain peaks with diamonds inside.\n- Same EXACT pattern, motif, gemstones, prongs, engravings, surface finish.\n- DO NOT simplify the decoration. DO NOT reduce the number of rows / gemstones / details. DO NOT reinterpret a 3D relief as flat engraving. DO NOT change pavé to channel-set. DO NOT remove design elements to simplify.\n- DO NOT redesign anything. If you cannot perfectly reproduce a decoration element, copy it EXACTLY from the source rather than approximating.\n\n📐 ANGLE & FRAMING — Mood catalog signature :\n- Camera at near eye-level with a slight downward tilt (about 10-15° plunge).\n- The ring is laid flat horizontally on the (invisible) surface.\n- The ring is slightly tilted in 3/4 perspective so you can see :\n  · The decorated outer band-surface on TOP (visible in slight foreshortening).\n  · The polished inner hole as a HORIZONTAL OVAL visible on the right side (or left, your choice based on which side of the ring is most informative).\n  · A hint of the side profile at the front.\n- Format: SQUARE 1:1.\n- The ring fills 85-95% of the frame width, centered.\n\n✂️ PIXEL-PRECISE CUTOUT on PURE WHITE :\n- 100% pure white background (#FFFFFF) — exactly RGB 255,255,255. NOT gray, NOT off-white, NOT cream.\n- Cut at the EXACT pixel boundary of the ring. No fuzzy edge, no halo, no colored fringe, no semi-transparent pixels.\n- Preserve every intricate detail: engravings, gemstones, prongs, small openings, the inner ring hole (background shows through it as pure white).\n- NO cast shadow on the (invisible) surface. The ring's own 3D self-shadow (modeling the band's volume) stays.\n\n✨ CLEANING (apply during the re-photograph) :\n- Remove all dust, lint, fingerprints, scratches, surface marks, fluff, water spots, residues, oily traces.\n- 🔧 THE BASE RAILS (the two polished metal stripes flanking the addon) must be NICKEL-MIRROR-POLISHED CLEAN — completely flawless, like a wedding band fresh from the final polish. ZERO scratches, ZERO marks, ZERO traces, ZERO dust visible on the rails. Sharp specular highlights and smooth gradients.\n- Gemstones sparkle clean and brilliant.\n- ⛔ Cleaning does NOT mean redesigning. Only remove parasites (dust, scratches, dirt) — never alter the design.\n\n🎨 INTERIOR COLOR MATCH (Mood ring specificity) :\n- IF the base of the source ring is COLORED (titanium anodized blue, pink, violet, gold, black, etc.) → the inner band of the ring visible through the hole is the SAME COLOR as the outer base. Anodized titanium is colored all around.\n- IF the base is NEUTRAL STEEL 316L → the inner band is silver polished steel.\n- DO NOT make the interior steel/silver when the base exterior is colored titanium. They MUST match.\n\n🎯 ADDON-BASE STRUCTURE (Mood ring anatomy) :\n- The addon (decorated central band) fills the ENTIRE central groove between the two polished metal rails of the base.\n- No overflow beyond rails, no gaps between addon and rails.\n- Addon and rails are FLUSH at the same surface height (no relief / no step / no shadow groove).\n- Addon has uniform width along the entire visible length.\n- Upper rail = lower rail (mirror-symmetric widths, addon centered vertically).\n\n💡 Lighting : even soft studio illumination, subtle gradient reflections on polished metal — no harsh hotspots, no flat ringlight, just clean even product light revealing every design detail.\n\n📏 Ring proportions identical to source — same overall band thickness, same width balance between rails and addon.\n\n⛔ ABSOLUTE BANS :\n- NO gray/off-white/cream background.\n- NO cast shadow on the surface.\n- NO redesigning, simplifying, or reinterpreting the ring's decoration.\n- NO reduction in the number/complexity of design elements.\n- NO changes to gemstones, materials, colors, or engravings.",

🎨 GLOBAL THEME OVERRIDE — "IN THE MOOD FOR" (soft luxury cozy Pinterest editorial)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

VISUAL DIRECTION :

- IF the action is a STUDIO / OBJECT shot (Fond blanc, Fond anthracite, Amélioration, Lumière contraste, Style photographe Mood) : replace neutral background with warm beige surface + cream textile drape in soft-focus background, very shallow DOF, ring sharp in foreground, soft warm natural light, delicate shadows.
- The ring itself is NEVER modified — same shape, color, material, finish, gemstones.

🔍 FRAMING — RING IS THE HERO, BIG IN THE FRAME (CRITICAL) :
- The ring DOMINATES the composition — it fills 70-85% of the frame width.
- This is a TIGHT MACRO / CLOSE-UP shot, like a luxury jewelry magazine product hero shot.
- The beige/cream cozy decor is a SUPPORTING BACKDROP, heavily blurred bokeh.
- The ring is the absolute focus subject — perfectly sharp.
- Camera : zoom in tight. Soft luxury decor is silent warm minimalism, never competing.`,

  • Coffret → all rings inside the same open Mood coffret (white leatherette interior), arranged elegantly together.
  • Bague Portée → multiple rings on the SAME ELEGANT HAND (different fingers), OR on the hands of the same model — one editorial close-up shot.
  • Style Photographe Mood → all rings in the same Léa narrative scene with consistent theme.
  • Amélioration / Lumière contraste → all rings cleaned and lit consistently in one scene.
  • Multi-formats → action does not apply to multi-ring mode (use single mode).` : "";

🚨 LARGEUR RÉELLE DE LA BAGUE — NON-NEGOTIABLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Mood Collection rings come in THREE PRECISE WIDTHS ONLY :
- Extra-small (XS) : 9 mm wide
- Small (S) : 11 mm wide
- Large (L) : 13 mm wide

The ring shown on the finger MUST KEEP ITS REAL PROPORTIONAL WIDTH from the source image — typically between 9 mm and 13 mm (about as wide as the width of one finger phalanx, NOT wider).

DO NOT enlarge / thicken / bulk up the ring to make it more visible. DO NOT show a 15-18 mm wide ring on the finger — that is INCORRECT. A Mood ring is SLIM and ELEGANT on the finger, occupying ~1/3 to ~1/2 of the finger's length between the joints. It should look comfortable on a real hand, never oversized or chunky.

If you zoom in tight on the ring (which you should — the ring is the hero), keep its width-to-finger ratio realistic. The ring fills the frame because the camera is close, NOT because the ring itself is enlarged.`;
